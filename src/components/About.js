              With a passion for both creativity and technology, I embarked on a
              journey that led me to the dynamic realm of Full Stack
              development. After completing my college degree in Computer
              Engineering in 2018, I honed my skills in 3D animation, creating
              captivating visuals that promote sports and fitness. This
              experience not only sparked my creativity but also served as the
              foundation for my transition into web and app development.

              In 2023, I embarked on a dedicated journey to deepen my knowledge
              by enrolling in the Dev Career Frontend Tech Program. Throughout
              the program, I immersed myself in frontend resources, translating
              UI figma designs into elegant, functional code while crafting demo
              projects that showcased my growing expertise.

              Fast forward to 2024, armed with newfound skills and a fervent
              drive to excel, I officially embarked on my developer career. I
              began crafting my portfolio websites, marking the inception of my
              Full Stack development journey. As I continue to evolve in this
              dynamic field, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of
              innovation and delivering exceptional digital experiences
